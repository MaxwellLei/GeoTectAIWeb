I've unified two projects related to tectonic setting assessment and created a website. If there are any additional details in the future, I will try to publish them there to keep the information consistent. Additionally, I would like to thank the following theme for its support:

> When I was in grad school, my senior told me that every lab has that one odd person. The boss recruits them so when everyone feels stressed, they can look at this person and feel like there's hope. Upon hearing this joke, I looked around and burst out laughing, "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, where's this person???" Everyone looked around, and finally turned to me, "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha." The lab was instantly filled with a cheerful atmosphere.
